                <ul>
                  <li>We suggest you only ask people of the same sex to read it with you. You'll be meeting them regularly and its best to have clear boundaries. </li>
                  <li>Before you meet with them, pray - ask God to help you as you open His word.</li>
                  <li>Don't ask them to do anything that would make them uncomfortable. You know your friend best, but be careful asking them questions. This might intimidate them or embarrass them if they don't know the answer. Don't ask them to read aloud, or pray. </li>
                  <li>Meet in a venue that makes them feel at ease - this could be anything from a coffee shop, to their own home. </li>
